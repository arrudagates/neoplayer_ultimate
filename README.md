# Neoplayer Ultimate

Rewrite of the original [Neoplayer](https://github.com/arrudagates/neoplayer), this time focusing on spotify instead of youtube (with youtube support coming too) and in Rust instead of JavaScript + Node

## Usage

When running for the first time, follow the instructions printed in the terminal to authenticate with spotify

Press 'h' to enter input mode
Commands currently available are:
```text
search <query> //searches spotify for the query and returns a list of results
play <query> //searches spotify for the query and plays the first result without displaying them
library //fetches the user's saved songs
```
When not in input mode, use arrows up and down to select tracks in the results list and press enter to play them
